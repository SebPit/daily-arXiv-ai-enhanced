However, direct signatures of extra dimensions\nare difficult to observe in many cases. This is the situation, for example, if\nthe energy scales associated with extra dimensions are close to the string or\nGrand Unification scale. The energetic early universe provides an exciting\nopportunity to overcome this challenge, since the heavy states associated with\nhigh-scale extra dimensions, such as scalar moduli and Kaluza-Klein (KK)\ngravitons, could have been produced on-shell at early epochs. In this work, we\nillustrate this by focusing on how such states can be produced during inflation\nand leave signatures in primordial non-Gaussianity (NG). Specifically, we\nconsider a 5D spacetime with a warped extra dimension that remains stabilized\nas inflation proceeds in the four non-compact dimensions. By discussing an\nexplicit stabilization mechanism, we compute the masses and couplings of the\nradion modulus and the KK graviton modes. Being gravitational degrees of\nfreedom, these unavoidably couple to the field(s) generating curvature\nperturbation, and can lead to observable NG with a distinctive oscillatory\nshape and characteristic angular dependence. We give example benchmarks which\ncan already be probed by the Planck data and identify targets for the future.\nOur study shows that cosmological surveys have the potential to observe\non-shell imprints of extra dimensions in the coming years."}

Neutrino oscillation remains the most powerful experimental tool\nfor addressing many of these questions, including whether neutrinos violate\ncharge-parity (CP) symmetry, which has possible connections to the unexplained\npreponderance of matter over antimatter in the universe. Oscillation\nmeasurements also probe the mass-squared differences between the different\nneutrino mass states ($\\Delta m^2$), whether there are two light states and a\nheavier one (normal ordering) or vice versa (inverted ordering), and the\nstructure of neutrino mass and flavor mixing. Here, we carry out the first\njoint analysis of data sets from NOvA and T2K, the two currently operating\nlong-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments (hundreds of kilometers of\nneutrino travel distance), taking advantage of our complementary experimental\ndesigns and setting new constraints on several neutrino sector parameters.

In this letter, we exploit this new perspective to develop\nconceptually novel methods of computing YM tree amplitudes. First, using\nstandard gluon factorization to determine all terms with poles, we show how\ngauge invariance uniquely fixes the piece with no poles (the \"contact term\")\nfrom only terms that have a single pole. This allows us to write a YM recursion\nnot only for the full amplitude but also for the amplitude up to any order in\nthe Laurent series. Next, by imposing gauge invariance for terms with poles, we\nwrite down relations which compute numerators recursively in the amplitude's\nLaurent series expansion. Starting from an initial set of cuts depending only\non the $(n-1)$-point amplitude, these formulae allow us to determine the\nremaining terms in the $n$-point amplitude. Finally, we use this \"Laurent\nseries recursion\" to derive a recursion solely for the contact term. We\nspeculate on the possibility that this and analogous recursions for any term in\nthe amplitude may be solved. In attached Mathematica notebooks, we give\nimplementations of these three recursions."}

This setup defines a family of classical open-string\nS-matrices that smoothly interpolates between perturbative parton scattering at\nweak coupling and flat-space string scattering at strong coupling. We focus on\nthe four-point amplitude, which exhibits a remarkably rich structure: nonlinear\nRegge trajectories, dual conformal invariance, an intricate spectrum of bound\nstates with an accumulation point, and a two-particle cut. Dual conformal\ninvariance relates the spectrum of Regge trajectories to the energy spectrum of\nthe Maldacena-Wilson cusp Hamiltonian. This connection allows us to use\nintegrability to compute the leading and subleading Regge trajectories at\nfinite coupling, which we then input in the bootstrap analysis. At strong\ncoupling, we use the worldsheet bootstrap to construct the first\n$AdS$-curvature correction to the Veneziano amplitude. We apply dispersion\nrelations and S-matrix bootstrap techniques to derive bounds on Wilson\ncoefficients, couplings to bound states, and the overall shape of the\namplitude. We find that the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ amplitude saturates the bootstrap\nbounds at weak coupling and nearly saturates them at strong coupling. At\nintermediate coupling, the amplitude traces a nontrivial path through the\nallowed space of observables. To characterize this path, we combine the weak-\nand strong-coupling information about the amplitude to construct a\nfinite-coupling model for Wilson coefficients using a Pad\\'{e} approximation.\nThe resulting model satisfies bootstrap constraints and yields sharp\npredictions for the finite-coupling behavior of the amplitude.

Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating\noptimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces\ntwo major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local\ndeployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks\nhave spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more\nlightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs\ncan achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can\nmatch LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to\nsuboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.\nTo bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented\ngeneration framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.\nReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning\ngraph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and\nleverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration.

For small perturbations, we also extend our discussion to\ngauge-invariantly defined subregions of spacetime, where the quantum\ncontribution is replaced by the Berry curvature of certain special\npurifications involving the Connes cocycle. In the AdS/CFT context, the\nsemi-classical symplectic form defined here is naturally dual to the Berry\ncurvature in the boundary CFT."}

A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute\nwhen left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order\ndecoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs\nto infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish\nbetween reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer\nuncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an\nanswer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the\nMDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new\nsource of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that\nfine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a\nperformance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.\nAdditionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for\nscoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps.

MED preserves performance across\nbenchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the\ntraining and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training\nmethods."}

We\nempirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and\nprototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training\nprototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without\nnecessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint\noptimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns\nprototypes and encoders under separate objectives.

Most existing time series forecasting models are\noptimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often\nstruggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or\nheart rate spikes.

While prior work has explored\nbackdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,\nconditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely\nunexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting\nlatent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages\ntextual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that\ninduce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,\nwhile preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on\nfour benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the\neffectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can\nachieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,\nwith negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies\nfurther reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training\nrather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in\nlatent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious\nrisks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need\nfor robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models."}

Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each\nrequiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid\ndeployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)\nOnly a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --\neliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's\nsingular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the\nfactorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple\nsubspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces\noverfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to\n24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just\n100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the\nindicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to\nfurther reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream\ntasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show\nthat combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for\ndownstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a\nquick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can\nadapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning."}

We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does\nnot necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with\nreverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).\nInstead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal\ntarget distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode\ncoverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,\nand relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we\nshow commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal\nverifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the\noptimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these\ninsights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified\nalgorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a\ntarget distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling\nmodes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large\nLanguage Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality\nand diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both\nforward and reverse KL when using either naively fails."}

Like many\nincarnations of BSM physics this model has a number (four) of arbitrary\nparameters, which determine the experimental signals, and cosmological\nobservables such as the dark matter relic density. We show that analysis of the\nphenomenology can be greatly accelerated by using symbolic expressions derived\nfor the observables in terms of the input parameters. Here we focus on the\nHiggs mass, the cold dark matter relic density, and the contribution to the\nanomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We find that SR can produce remarkably\naccurate expressions. Using them we make global fits to derive the posterior\nprobability densities of the CMSSM input parameters which are in good agreement\nwith those performed using conventional methods. Moreover, we demonstrate a\nmajor advantage of SR which is the ability to make fits using differentiable\nmethods rather than sampling methods. We also compare the method with neural\nnetwork (NN) regression. SR produces more globally robust results, while NNs\nrequire data that is focussed on the promising regions in order to be equally\nperformant."}
