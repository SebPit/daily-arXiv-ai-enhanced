However, direct signatures of extra dimensions\nare difficult to observe in many cases. This is the situation, for example, if\nthe energy scales associated with extra dimensions are close to the string or\nGrand Unification scale. The energetic early universe provides an exciting\nopportunity to overcome this challenge, since the heavy states associated with\nhigh-scale extra dimensions, such as scalar moduli and Kaluza-Klein (KK)\ngravitons, could have been produced on-shell at early epochs. In this work, we\nillustrate this by focusing on how such states can be produced during inflation\nand leave signatures in primordial non-Gaussianity (NG). Specifically, we\nconsider a 5D spacetime with a warped extra dimension that remains stabilized\nas inflation proceeds in the four non-compact dimensions. By discussing an\nexplicit stabilization mechanism, we compute the masses and couplings of the\nradion modulus and the KK graviton modes. Being gravitational degrees of\nfreedom, these unavoidably couple to the field(s) generating curvature\nperturbation, and can lead to observable NG with a distinctive oscillatory\nshape and characteristic angular dependence. We give example benchmarks which\ncan already be probed by the Planck data and identify targets for the future.\nOur study shows that cosmological surveys have the potential to observe\non-shell imprints of extra dimensions in the coming years.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores how extra dimensions, particularly in warped 5D spacetimes, can produce detectable signatures in primordial non-Gaussianity during inflation, offering a novel cosmological probe for high-scale extra dimensions.", "motivation": "Detecting direct evidence of extra dimensions is challenging due to high associated energy scales, but the early universe offers a unique opportunity to observe imprints from heavy states linked to extra dimensions.", "method": "The authors focus on a 5D spacetime with a warped extra dimension stabilized during inflation, compute masses and couplings for radion moduli and KK gravitons, and analyze their gravitational coupling to curvature perturbation fields to predict observable non-Gaussian features.", "result": "They find that these gravitational modes can induce distinctive oscillatory and angular-dependent non-Gaussianity signatures, some of which can already be constrained by existing Planck data, with clear targets for future observations.", "conclusion": "Cosmological surveys have promising potential to detect on-shell signatures of extra dimensions through primordial non-Gaussianities, opening a new window into high-energy physics beyond the Standard Model."}}

Backus"], "title": "New Recursions for the Canonical Scalar-Scaffolded Yang-Mills Amplitude", "comment": "13 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "The recently-developed \"scalar-scaffolding\" formulation of gluon amplitudes\ncasts the Yang-Mills (YM) amplitude as a well-defined Laurent series expansion\nin scalar variables, valid for any spacetime dimension and helicity\nconfiguration. In this letter, we exploit this new perspective to develop\nconceptually novel methods of computing YM tree amplitudes. First, using\nstandard gluon factorization to determine all terms with poles, we show how\ngauge invariance uniquely fixes the piece with no poles (the \"contact term\")\nfrom only terms that have a single pole. This allows us to write a YM recursion\nnot only for the full amplitude but also for the amplitude up to any order in\nthe Laurent series. Next, by imposing gauge invariance for terms with poles, we\nwrite down relations which compute numerators recursively in the amplitude's\nLaurent series expansion. Starting from an initial set of cuts depending only\non the $(n-1)$-point amplitude, these formulae allow us to determine the\nremaining terms in the $n$-point amplitude. Finally, we use this \"Laurent\nseries recursion\" to derive a recursion solely for the contact term. We\nspeculate on the possibility that this and analogous recursions for any term in\nthe amplitude may be solved.

In\nthis work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning\nenergy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable\nsubproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given\nproblem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This\ncompositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints\nduring inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems\nof increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly\nconstructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM).\nWe evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to\ngeneralize to larger and more complex problems.

It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a\ntarget distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling\nmodes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large\nLanguage Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality\nand diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both\nforward and reverse KL when using either naively fails.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper challenges the common belief that reverse KL leads to mode seeking and forward KL to mass covering in reinforcement learning, showing that mode coverage depends more on regularization strength and reward scales. It proposes a new algorithm that improves diversity and quality in sampling modes for language models by adjusting reward magnitudes with minimal changes.", "motivation": "To investigate and clarify misconceptions in how reverse and forward KL divergences influence mode coverage in reinforcement learning, particularly in language models, and to improve sample diversity without relying on external diversity signals.", "method": "Mathematically and empirically analyze the effects of reverse and forward KL regularization on target distributions and mode coverage, identify key factors such as regularization strength and reward scales influencing diversity, and develop a simple scalable algorithm that adjusts reward magnitudes to achieve diverse, high-quality modes.", "result": "The proposed algorithm effectively improves sample quality and diversity in both Large Language Models and Chemical Language Models during post-training, succeeding where naive applications of forward or reverse KL regularization fail, and operates without external diversity signals.", "conclusion": "Mode coverage in reinforcement learning with KL regularization is primarily influenced by factors other than the KL direction, such as reward magnitude and regularization strength, and adjusting these enables a simple algorithm to realize diverse and high-quality sampling modes across different KL formulations."}}
